		        Comment from Ben:
		        
		        1) Be careful with your curly braces! You open a curly brace
		        on line 64 but don't close it!
		        
		        2) I like that you are making an if statement using the "<" operator.
		        It makes sense that if "> boardWidth" checks for the right side then
		        "< boardWidth" checks for the left, but that's not quite right logic. Why?
		        
		        Some important coordinates:
		        x = 0 on the left edge of the screen
		        x = boardWidth on the right edge of the screen (boardWidth is just a variable holding the actual value which depends on how wide the window is)
		        
		        When position = boardWidth, the box is all the way on the right edge 
		        of the screen so if position is GREATER than boardWidth then we know we 
		        want to turn the box around and change the direction to -1 (as you've done). 
		        
		        Now, we want to check if the box has gone past the left of the LEFT EDGE of the screen where
		        we know that x = 0. Given that, how can we write an if statement that checks for this? 
		        
		        Then,at this point what do we want to set direction to? (See below for a hint)
		        
		        3) When we first create the direction variable it is set to 1 and the box
		        moves to the right. Changing the direction to -1 makes the box move left. 
		        Look at line 62 and think about why that is... Given that, when the box
		        bounces off the left side, we don't want to set direction = 0, what should we
		        set direction to to get the box to move to the right again?
		        */

				// TODO 4 / 5

			};


			//this calls update every 50 milliseconds
			setInterval(update, 50);
			// this calls the handle handleBoxClick function every time the box is clicked on
			box.on('click', handleBoxClick);
